## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a personal project mostly for fun! I hope you can find a use for this code.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.


```
Python3
	- requests
	- json
	- base64
	- bs4
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

```
Give an example
